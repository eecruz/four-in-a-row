# SER210 ConnectFour Game

## What is this?
This is a game created for Quinnipiac's SER210 Android Development class.

## How to run this project?
I did not use any external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it in the console with Kotlin.

I recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the main.kt file.

## Rules and Gameplay
The game follows the traditional rules of tic-tac-toe, except players are aiming for four in a row/column/diagonal to win as opposed to three. Users will play against a computer, each taking turns making moves on a 6x6 matrix. Valid moves include tiles 0-35. The computer will try to block player wins going either horizontally or vertically.
