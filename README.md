# SER210 ConnectFour Game

## What is this?
This is a game created for Quinnipiac's SER210 Android Development class.

## How to run this project?
I did not use any external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it out of the box with Kotlin

I recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the main.kt file.
